        rgb21_section9_p2: "In this context, <strong>Ark</strong> (a Bitcoin Layer-2 scaling system built around VTXOs or Virtual Transaction Outputs) can serve as a settlement or execution layer for RGB assets:",

        rgb21_section9_li5: "<strong>Security Through Bitcoin</strong>: Both RGB and Ark rely on Bitcoin’s base layer for final settlement and security without requiring protocol changes. Users retain the ability to claim assets or value back on Bitcoin. <br><em>Result:</em> Strong security guarantees with minimal trust assumptions.",
        rgb21_section9_li6: "<strong>Self-Custody & Privacy</strong>: RGB uses client-side validation, meaning asset owners validate contract state locally without public broadcast. Ark users maintain control of their VTXOs with exit paths to Bitcoin. <br><em>Result:</em> Enhanced user control and privacy for ownership and transfer data.",
        rgb21_section9_p5: "<strong>Programmability + Fast UX</strong>: By combining RGB’s rich asset logic with Ark’s fast off-chain transaction layer, developers can build applications that offer the user experience of traditional DApps but settle on Bitcoin’s secure base layer.",
